            You lift me up high
            You spread my wings
            And fly me to the sky
            I feel so alive
            It's like my soul thrives in your light
            
            But how I wish you'd be
            Here with me all year around
            
            Ramadan Ramadan

            Love is everywhere
            So much peace fills up the air
            Ramadan month of the Quran
            I feel it inside of me, strengthening my Iman
            
            But how I wish you'd be
            Here with me all year around

            I just love the way you make me feel
            Every time you come around you
            Breathe life into my soul
            And I promise that
            I'll try throughout the year
            To keep your spirit alive In my heart it never dies
            Oh Ramadan!

        <h3>About Mahirzain</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Maher Zain is a Swedish singer, songwriter, and musician, originally from Lebanon. He is best known for 
            his music albums ‘Thank You Allah’ and ‘Forgive Me.’ He was born in Tripoli, Lebanon, and moved with his
            family to Sweden when he was 8 years old. Although his father himself was a singer in Lebanon, Maher 
            knew that it was not going to be easy for him to be part of the hip-hop music scene. He ventured into
            music at a very early age, after he got a keyboard at the age of 10. He learned to play the keyboard
            himself. When he got into school, he spent nights with friends, learning to make music. In 2005, he 
            was introduced to Swedish music producer RedOne. In 2006, RedOne moved to the US and Maher followed
            suit. In 2009, Maher released his debut album, ‘Thank You Allah.’ The album resonated with the 
            youth, especially in Muslim countries. The album became a major success, and the succeeding albums,
            ‘Forgive Me’ and ‘One,’ also became popular. He has a major fan following in Malaysia, where he was
            the most-Googled personality in 2010.
